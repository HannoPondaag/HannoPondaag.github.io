                <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/custom-sudoku/9ns9twkq4c62?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Custom Sudoku is in the Microsoft Store !</A>: Sudoku puzzle player/helper program: Input or bring any of your own Sudoku puzzles. Play them, save them and reload & continue them (one at a time) ! With nice Sound Effects. With New neat Lay-out. <br>
                After inputting the numbers of your choice finish the Puzzle you have by confirming your inputs with touching or pressing the [Lock numbers] symbol with your forefinger or mouse.<br>
               Basically the Game tolerates or allows for 2 mistakes a Person to make. Once you make a 3rd Number incorrect input; it is Game Over.
               In combination with the Pencil symbol or icon you can make 'little notes' or let's say input the 'little Numbers' as reminders into the booths.
                In combination with the black disk symbol you can Save a puzzle before Quitting, with the black 'refresh' symbol you can reload a previously Saved Puzzle from an earlier Run. Reloading, after 'Quitting and saving' are working 'out-of-the-box', there is no such a thing necessary as/ NO 'Run(ning) as Administrator' or something.
                Only use the black disk symbol for saving in combination with Quitting an unfinished puzzle, switching to built in puzzles or restarting the system. But don't forget to, it makes life easier. NB: there is NO autosave functionality in the Program when aborting or Quitting it. <br>
               
                - With 80 Puzzles built in (4 levels: easy, medium, hard & very hard) to load from resources ! <br>
                Do you want the default built in Puzzles ? <br>
                First, for example, you select the puzzle number with the arrows in the horizontal aligned direction (keep an eye on 'Status ..' while selecting).  <br>
                Second, with the arrows in the vertical aligned direction, you can Change the level of the Puzzle selected (keep an eye on 'Status ..' while selecting). <br>
                Then in combination with the 'yellow' refresh symbol you can load the resulting selected puzzle (see Status: ..) from resources; you can load only One Puzzle you choose at a time. <br>
                
                <br>
                Tips or Remarks: - In some cases you might want to adjust your screen resolution according to what best suits you to a mode that fits with everything in the focus of the screen, for instance on a tablet.<br>
                  - For a more pleasurable seamless experience on a tablet: make sure you work with a full battery, unless you are plugged into a wall socket with your device so your tablet stays charged all the time.<br>
                  - solving a Puzzle together with someone (for instance: your Spouse, Partner, Friend or Aquaintance) can perhaps be pleasurable also.
