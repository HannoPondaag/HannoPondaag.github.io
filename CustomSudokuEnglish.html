        <A HREF="https://hannopondaag.github.io/CustomSudoku/index.html">WebGl version of Custom Sudoku</A>: Sudoku puzzle player/helper program: fill in a sudoku puzzle, play it, save it and load it! 
       Or play one out of 80 puzzles built in ! Four different levels: easy, medium, hard & very hard ! <br>
       One can Puzzle on some Smart tv's, with a mouse attached or plugged in a USB port, as well as on desktop, laptop or tablet computers. Even on some smartphones. <br>
       To deselect a green selected arrow: click on a randomly chosen green spot in the screen area !<br>
       Sudoku Puzzle Player/Toolbox, it will verify sudoku puzzles: Input or bring your own Sudoku puzzles, any of your choice (from Puzzle booklets, newspapers or magazines for instance). Play them, save them and reload & continue them (one at a time) ! With nice Sound Effects. With New neat Lay-out. <br>
                After inputting the numbers of your choice finish the Puzzle you have by confirming your inputs with touching or pressing the [Lock numbers] symbol with your forefinger or mouse.<br>
               Basically the Game tolerates or allows for 2 mistakes a Person to make. Once you make a 3rd Number incorrect input; it is Game Over.
               In combination with the Pencil symbol or icon you can make 'little notes' or let's say input the 'little Numbers' as reminders into the square boxes.
                In combination with the black disk symbol you can Save a puzzle before Quitting. With the black 'refresh' symbol you can reload a previously Saved Puzzle from an earlier Run. Reloading, after 'Quitting and saving' are working 'out-of-the-box', there is no such a thing necessary as/ NO 'Run(ning) as Administrator' or something.
                Use the black disk symbol for saving in combination with Quitting an unfinished puzzle, switching to built in puzzles or restarting the system. But don't forget to Saved now and then, it makes life easier. NB: there is NO autosave functionality in the Program when aborting or Quitting it. <br>
               
                - With 80 Puzzles built in (4 levels: easy, medium, hard & very hard) to load from memory ! <br>
                Do you want the default built in Puzzles ? <br>
                First, for example, you select the puzzle number with the arrows in the horizontal aligned direction (keep an eye on 'Status ..' while adjusting).  <br>
                Second, with the arrows in the vertical aligned direction, you can Change the level of the Puzzle selected (keep an eye on 'Status ..' while adjusting). <br>
                Then in combination with the yellow refresh symbol you can load the resulting selected puzzle (see Status: ..) from memory resources, after pressing the 'Start button for restarting the workload with the right information (Puzzle No & Level) displaying and selected; you can load only One Puzzle at a time. <br>
                
                <br>
                Tips or Remarks: - In some cases you might want to adjust your screen resolution according to what best suits you to a mode that fits with everything in the focus of the screen, for instance on a tablet: 1920 x 1080 (example).<br>
                  - For a more pleasurable seamless experience on a tablet: make sure you work with a full battery, unless you are plugged into a wall socket with your device so your tablet stays charged all the time.<br>
                  - solving a Puzzle together with someone (for instance: your Spouse, Partner, Friend or Aquaintance) can perhaps be pleasurable also. 'Who is finishing the Puzzle first..?!'
