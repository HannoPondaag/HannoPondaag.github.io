">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address) or Net Four In A Row program.
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding on port 1200.



        <p></p>
        Your own local IP-address: you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from playing on the WAN internet:
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        There may be some MODEM settings necessary, see e.g. for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch

        About my Net Four In A Row game & the like: Results for KPN provider testcases in the Netherlands with two different Modems..
                    <BR><p>
            Case #1; [Connect]-ing two computers in a (Wireless) home network situation using KPN Modem Sagemcom box B12<br>
                Player #1 is enabling UPnP IGD on the Modem.<br>   
                Make a rule for a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem. & make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching the host address of his or her computer for filling in the internal host in the Modem, with CMD.EXE (search window on taskbar) & ipconfig.<br>
                       In a field with external host of the Modem of Player #1 with Port forwarding IPV4  will show an asterisk: *.<br>
                       Player #1 is searching the external host adres then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer,[Listen]<br>
                       Player #1 is setting in his or her inputfield  the host address of computer 2 of Player #2, his or her computer, which can be found in the Modem.<br>
                       Player #2 is setting in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touched or clicked with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later Player #2 will do the same.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded !<br>
                       
                       
                            <br>
