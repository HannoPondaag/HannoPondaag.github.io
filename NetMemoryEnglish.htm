        <BR>
            There may be some MODEM settings necessary, UDP must be set to on, where appropriate, portforwarding on port 1200 (try to experiment & test if the connection fails, try a combination with port 1201 or the two 1200/1201 perhaps will work, I'm not sure with this !) see e.g. for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch
        You can choose from animals, birds, flowers, alphabet, greek alphabet and numbers with different number of cards all integrated in 1 executable.
        Rightclick the Net Memory .NET English icon in windows startmenu and select more..run as administrator to be able to save recorded games and the Hall Of Fame data!
        <br />Remark: Use the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play', in case of a card is staying on the screen or when the program does'nt seem to respond any longer.., while the connection maybe alive!!
        <br />If this somehow doesn't resolve your problem, try to RESTORE the remainder of the game with the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play' from the other side of the connection and try to continue the game then.
        The score should then be resend also.. Good Luck, some times flipping a card results in a hang and the program fails to continue.
        Likewise a UDP Protocol, TCP/IP connection seems not always 100 percent reliable !
        Your own local IP-address:<br> you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        

        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from playing on the WAN internet:<BR>
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        
    <LI>
        <A HREF="https://whatismyipaddress.com/
">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address).
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding (look under NAT, Network Address Translation)

            ---------------------------        


        </TR><BR>
            About my Memory Game(s) Series: Results for KPN provider testcases in the Netherlands with two different Modems..
                    <BR><p>
            Case #1; [Connect]-ing two computers in a (Wireless) home network situation using KPN Modem Sagemcom box B12<br>
            <p></p>
                Player #1 is enabling UPnP IGD on the Modem.<br>   
                Make a rule for a Memory Game x game or a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem. & make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching the host address of his or her computer for filling in the internal host in the Modem, with CMD.EXE (search window on taskbar) & ipconfig.<br>
                       In a field with external host of the Modem of Player #1 with Port forwarding IPV4  will show an asterisk: *.<br>
                       Player #1 is searching the external host adres then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer, [Listen]<br>
                       Player #1 is setting in his or her inputfield  the host address of computer 2 of Player #2. This address of his or her computer can be found in the Modem. (It is one from the private network addresses in the 192.168.xxx.xxx range, like for example 192.168.2.7 in my case)<br>
                       Player #2 is setting in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touched or clicked with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later Player #2 will do the same.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded !<br>
                       
                       
                            <br>
                            Case #2; [Connect]-ing the computer's Modem KPN Experia 10A Box over ADSL & the internet with your opponent (to an Online.nl Provider Modem): within 'A city':<br>
              <p></p>
                            Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2..<br>
                                  Fill in the Modem with Poort forwarding, nieuw item (or existing item, while repeating the test/procedure), LAN Host : the host address of the internal host as acquired in the way of 
                                  Case #1; in my case it is 192.168.2.8 .. (use CMD.EXE & then ipconfig in order to get it again..)<br>
                                  The rule for my opponent in his Modem remains the same like in previous testcase Case #1, as way ago was set for his Online.nl Modem (some years ago for NetMemory.exe, I believe)..<br>
                                  Next my opponent Player #2 is looking up his external IP host address via..<br>

               ">getting to know your  IP-address </A>: this he/her will send via WhatsApp or phone, with next his/her opponent is able to fill in later in his/her inputfield of the Program (IPV4 address). <br>   
                                  ..and sends this to me, Player #1 by means of Whatsapp or rather (smart)phone.<br>
                                      I as in Player#1, will look up my external host IP address as well and do the same..<br>
                                      Player #1 is writing down the external host IP Address of Player #2, which he or she sended. The just acquired address via Whatsapp or phone, from Player #1 &  is written down by Player #2, for using in a future game later likewise..<br>
                                  Next both Players touch or click,  with their mousepointers,  [Listen] , while Whatsapp- or (smart)phone line or connection is open.<br>
                                  Next both Players will fill in the acquired external host IP addresses from their opponents in the inputfields of their Programs for a kind of endpoint IP addresses purpose.<br>
                                  Next both Players touch or click, with their mousepointers, [Enter] , while Whatsapp or (smart)phone connection remains open for the verification later..<br>
                                  Next Player #1 counts 3..2..1..  and touches or clicks [Connect] , with his or her mousepointer.<br>
                                  Next Player #2 will shortly later also touch or click [Connect], with his or her mousepointer (for instance a 1 Ã  2 sec period later)..<br>
                                      My brother, Player #2  and me, Player #1 are playing at this time.. <br>
                                      My brother wins this first game, Net Four In A Row, as a test application.<br>
                                      Result: test succeeds ! (Full duplex connection established).<br><br>

        Tips: -Type ipconfig at the command prompt to discover your ip4 address to use with one of the games.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - all games: Make sure your font size is set to default 96 DPI when used in Windows Vista : this can be achieved; type font in control panel..
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't forget to make first a Connect(ion) then Start !
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't play too fast, keep e.g. a minimum time interval of one second between mouseclicks
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: You can really play it via internet and also by connecting a standard network cable (UTP) between 2 PC's or over a LAN with e.g. a friend.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: If you play with two people use the same version of the program (Delphi or Qt or Java programmed). This is the only way the two instances or programs can communicate properly !
