            <h2 id="Description">Description:</h2>
            There may be some MODEM settings necessary, UDP must be set to on, where appropriate, portforwarding on port 1200 (try to experiment & test if the connection fails, try a combination with port 1201 or the two 1200/1201 perhaps will work, I'm not sure with this !) see e.g. for KPN users the document : 'opmerkingen voor KPN gebruikers', in dutch.
        One can choose from animals, birds, flowers, alphabet, greek alphabet and numbers with different number of cards all integrated in 1 executable.
        Rightclick the Net Memory .NET English icon in windows searchwindow result after lookup and select: Run as administrator, to be able to save the 'Hall Of Fame' data of (solo ?) games that were finished !
        <br />Remark: Use the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play', in case of a card is staying on the screen or when the program does'nt seem to respond any longer.., while the connection maybe alive !!
        <br />If this somehow doesn't resolve your problem, try to RESTORE the remainder of the game with the 'Send' option in the menu 'Play' from the other side of the connection and try to continue the game then.
        The score should then be resend also.. Good Luck, some times flipping a card results in a hang and the program fails to continue.
        Likewise a UDP Protocol, TCP/IP connection seems not always 100 percent reliable !
        Your own local IP-address:<br> you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        

        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from playing on the WAN internet:<BR>
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/ in the link below.
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        
    <LI>
        <A HREF="https://whatismyipaddress.com/
">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address), keep the line open during game play.
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding (look under NAT, Network Address Translation)

           <h3> About my Memory Game(s) Series: Results for KPN provider as merely a sort of<h2><u>testcases & User Guides</u></h2> in the Netherlands with two (different) Modems..for my internet Games: Memory Game(s) Series and Four In A Row games..</h3>
                    <BR><p>
                        <h2 id="Case1">Case #1</h2> [Connect]-ing two computers in a (Wireless) home network situation using KPN Modem Sagemcom box B12<br>
            <p></p>
             First you may want to know, when a connection is established between two instances of such a Memory Game X, you can touch, or click with your mouse, the [Send] (the remainder of) a (partly) (hidden) game button to 'beam' or let's say 'teleport' a game anytime.
              
                Player #1 is enabling UPnP IGD on the Modem.<br>   
                Make a rule for a Memory Game x game or a Net Four In A Row version in the Modem. & make sure it is turned on.<br>
                Save the just made changes.<br>
                       Let's say: you are Player #1, your opponent Player #2.<br>
                       Then Player #1 is searching the host address of his or her computer for filling in the internal host in the Modem, with CMD.EXE (search window on taskbar) & ipconfig.<br>
                       In a field 'external host' of the Modem of Player #1 with Port forwarding IPV4 thing should become recognized as an asterisk: *.<br>
                       Player #1 is searching the external host address then, this will Player #2 fill in in the inputfield of his or her or program later.<br>
                       Then if the data in the Modem was saved, Player #2 touches or presses or clicks, with his or her mousepointer, [Listen]<br>
                       Player #1 is setting in his or her inputfield  the host address of computer 2 of Player #2. This address of his or her computer can be found in the Modem. (It is one from the private network addresses in the 192.168.xxx.xxx range, like for example 192.168.2.7 in my case)<br>
                       Player #2 is setting in the inputfield of the program on computer 2, the external host IP address.<br>
                       Once [Enter] is touched or pressed with the mousepointer, Player #1 is counting 3..2..1.. & Player #1 touched or clicked with the mousepointer [Connect], after this 1 of 2 sec. approximately later Player #2 will do the same.<br>
                       Result: Test Succeeded !<br>

                                  The rule for my opponent in his Modem remains the same like in previous testcase <a href="#Case1">Case #1</a>, as way ago was set for his Online.nl Modem (some years ago for NetMemory.exe, I believe)..<br>

 One with KPN MODEM Sagemcom Experia box B12 with a MS Windows tablet computer via fiber and Wi-Fi hotspot to the other, a laptop, through an Android 9 mobile smartphone in home network situation (in this way over the internet is working also to your family, Friend or aquaintance!) for inter-connecting the data of chips play to and from the tablet for the Game to a laptop instance of the Game:</u><br>
                Make sure that your resolution is set in such away that all elements fall within the frame, and that there is no overlap between the input field and 'the blue rack' or any elements in the Four In A Row version.<br>
                'Player #1', in Access Control-->Portforwarding--, has turned UPnP IGD on again in the KPN Sagemcom Experia box B12 Modem/Router..<br>
         
          ..<br>
          Create a separate rule for a Memory Game x game or a Four-in-a-Row version in the Modem in the manner described in  <a href="#Case1">Case #1</a>. <br>
        
          Create a hotspot on your mobile smartphone over WiFi & connect the computer /tablet of 'Player #2' via the mobile smartphone over WiFi, the smartphone itself serves as a Wifi point (e.g. temporarily during the procedure of building up a connection and while playing later).. <br>        
          Vervolgens zoekt mijn 'tegenstander', 'Speler #2' zijn external IP host address op via..<br>
          (to be edited later this line or sentence(s)/under contruction)..een adres uit de zogenaamde PrivÃ©-reeks op 'zijn of haar apparaat'..<br>
          Look into (i) on your hotspot on your computer or tablet. Of you click (i), Network and Internet will appear.
          There you'll find the IP4 Address of your hotspot to your mobile.
  (to be edited later here comes an image of device #2 of 'Player #2' screenshot)..<br>
  Myself, 'Player #1', also look up my external host IP address, in the usual way via a website or the Modem. <br>
  'Player #1' notes the external host IP Address of 'Player #2', which he or she receives via Whatsapp or phone from 'Player #2' & 'Player #2' notes that of 'Player #1', for later use. <br>
  Both 'Players' press or click, with their mouse pointer, then on [Listen], while Whatsapp or phone line is open in a situation over the internet. <br>
  Both 'Players' enter the external IP addresses, which they have previously obtained e.g. by telephone from their 'opponent', in the input field as an end point or end device address. <br>
  Both 'Players' press [Enter] shortly after each other (the Whatsapp or telephone line remains open for verification later, in a situation over the internet)<br>
  'Player #1' counts 3..2..1.. if he or she has pressed or clicked [Connect] with his or her mouse pointer. <br>
  'Player #2' also presses or clicks [Connect] (with his/her mouse pointer) shortly afterwards, e.g. 1 to 2 seconds later. <br>
  'Player #2' plays and Player #1 also plays.. <br>
                 
  Result: test passed! Connection accomplished. <br><br>
  Good luck!
  NB this test was done by connecting two devices of my own and 'supposedly' playing.. (with myself as a test)

">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for the Memory Games </p>
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding on port 1200.



        <p></p>
        Your own local IP-address: you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt for connecting in a LAN.
        <BR></BR>
        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different from playing on the WAN internet:
        The IP-address to connect, you fill this in: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        <p></p>
        The IP-address from your opponent on the WAN: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her.
        He/she can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.

        Tips: -Type ipconfig at the command prompt to discover your ip4 address to use with one of the games.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - all games: Make sure your font size is set to default 96 DPI when used in Windows Vista : this can be achieved; type font in control panel..
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't forget to make first a Connect(ion) then Start !
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: Don't play too fast, keep e.g. a minimum time interval of one second between mouseclicks
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: You can really play it via internet and also by connecting a standard network cable (UTP) between 2 PC's or over a LAN with e.g. a friend.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: If you play with two people use the same programming language version of the program (Delphi or 'Qt & C++' or 'Unity & C#' programmed). This is the only way the two instances or programs can communicate properly !
