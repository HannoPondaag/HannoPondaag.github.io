    Net Memory .NET is in the Microsoft Store !:
    <p></p>
    <LI>
        <A HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/net-memory-net-english/9p9dzdz8ndn8?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Net Memory .NET English</A>: a .NET version for Windows, programmed with Visual Studio Community 2017.
        Now, pay attention, 2 IP-addresses are important per person !
        Connect from both sides: fill in the local IP-address and then the IP-address of the remote PC.
        Your own local IP-address: you will find it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD or the command-prompt.
        The IP-address from your opponent: you will have to get it via WhatsApp e.g. from him/her and your own address for the outside
        world: you can get it from https://whatismyipaddress.com/ , see the link below. This address for the outside world
        : you have to send it to your opponent via WhatsApp of phone.
        If you choose port numbers 1200 and 1201 for example for user 1 and the remote user 2, then these port numbers must be in the reverse order on the other end of the connection: 1201 & 1200 !
        You can choose from animals, birds, flowers, alphabet, greek alphabet and numbers with different number of cards all integrated in 1 executable.
        Rightclick the Net Memory .NET English icon in windows startmenu and select more..run as administrator to be able to save recorded games and the Hall Of Fame data!

">Get to know your IP-address for the outside world </A>: send this via WhatsApp so your opponent can fill it in for Net Memory.NET (remote IP-address #2).
        Also you may want to configure your MODEM for port-forwarding (look under NAT, Network Address Translation)

        <BR></BR>
        Playing in a LAN (Local Area Network) or direct via an UTP-cable works somewhat different: Only 2 IP-addresses are of importance per person.
        The 1st local IP-address: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the command-prompt. You can type CMD in
        the search field on Windows 10 on your taskbar.
        In CMD look carefully for 'Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi' if your connected via Wi-Fi.
        The 2nd remote IP-address: you can get it by typing 'ipconfig' in CMD, the same procedure as the one for the 1st address, on the remote PC.

        Tips: -Type ipconfig at the command prompt to discover your ip4 address to use with one of the games.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - all games: make sure your font size is set to default 96 DPI: this can be achieved in vista: type font in control panel
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: first connect then start
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: don't play too fast, keep e.g. a minimum time interval of 1 second between mouseclicks
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: you can play it via internet and also by connecting a standard network cable (UTP) between 2 PC's or over a LAN.
        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       - Memory: if you play with 2 people use the same version of the program (delphi or Qt or Java). This is the only way the 2 programs can communicate properly!
